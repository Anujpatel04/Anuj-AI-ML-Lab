# Page-Indexed PDF RAG

A production-quality Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application for querying PDF documents with page-level precision. Built with Streamlit, OpenAI, and FAISS.

## Features

- **Page-Based Retrieval**: Each PDF page is treated as an individual retrieval unit, preserving document structure
- **Source Attribution**: All answers include explicit page number references
- **Grounded Responses**: LLM answers are strictly based on retrieved content with no hallucination
- **In-Memory Vector Search**: Fast similarity search using FAISS
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses text-embedding-3-small for embeddings and GPT-4o for generation

## Architecture

```
PDF Upload → Page Extraction → Embedding Generation → FAISS Index
                                                          ↓
User Query → Query Embedding → Similarity Search → Top-K Pages
                                                          ↓
                                              LLM Answer Generation
                                                          ↓
                                              Answer + Page Sources
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd RAGs/PageIndexed_RAG
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the parent directory (`RAGs/.env`) with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

Run the application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then:

1. Upload a PDF document using the file uploader
2. Enter your question in the text input field
3. Click Submit to get an answer with source page references

## Configuration

The following parameters can be modified in `app.py`:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | text-embedding-3-small | OpenAI embedding model |
| `CHAT_MODEL` | gpt-4o | OpenAI chat model |
| `TOP_K` | 3 | Number of pages to retrieve per query |

## Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| streamlit | Web interface |
| openai | Embeddings and chat completion |
| faiss-cpu | Vector similarity search |
| pypdf | PDF text extraction |
| python-dotenv | Environment variable management |
| numpy | Numerical operations |

## How It Works

1. **PDF Processing**: The uploaded PDF is parsed page-by-page using pypdf. Each page's text content is extracted and stored with its page number.

2. **Embedding Creation**: Page contents are converted to vector embeddings using OpenAI's embedding API.

3. **Index Building**: Embeddings are normalized and added to a FAISS inner-product index for fast similarity search.

4. **Query Processing**: User questions are embedded and compared against the page index to find the most relevant pages.

5. **Answer Generation**: Retrieved page content is passed to GPT-4o with a strict system prompt that enforces grounded, citation-backed responses.
